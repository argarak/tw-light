# tw-light

*"TW-Light is fork of TimeWarp. It includes only a combat portion
of TimeWarp. Main goal of this fork is a stable melee engine
for implementing adventure games."*

I will send a pull request to the repository of the owner (currently empty for some reason) so that they can host it.

[Repository by Yura Siamashka](https://github.com/Yurand/tw-light)

Contribution
============

If you notice any issues during the game and would like to contribute, 
please report them to the tracker.

If you fixed a bug or added a feature, please send a pull request.

Compilation
===========

To compile, run the following commands from any GNU/Linux (or 
possibly Mac OS and any other *nix) terminal while in the 
repository's directory,

```
./configure
make
sudo make install
```

(miss out `sudo make install` if you would like it to be installed 
locally in the ./src directory)
  
Alternatively, you can run `sh INSTALL` for a faster method if you would 
like it to be installed globally.
