# tw-light

*"TW-Light is fork of TimeWarp. It includes only a combat portion
of TimeWarp. Main goal of this fork is a stable melee engine
for implementing adventure games."*

The main goals of this fork are:

  * To have a fork of Tw-Light avaliable on Github as Google Code is becoming read-only
  * To *"revive"* Tw-Light as development has halted
  * To fix some frustrating performance issues caused during the game
  * Possibly add more features to the game. (Don't expect me to add much as I have not learned C++ yet)

If you notice any issues during the game and would like to contribute, 
please report them to the tracker.
  

Compilation
===========

To compile, run the following commands from any GNU/Linux (or 
possibly Mac OS and any other *nix) terminal while in the 
repository's directory,

```
./configure
make
sudo make install
```

(miss out `sudo make install` if you would like it to be installed 
locally in the ./src directory)
  
Alternatively, you can run 'sh INSTALL' for a faster method if you would 
like it to be installed globally.  

I'm afraid I cannot provide compilation instructions for Microsoft
Windows or any other non-*nix system.
